            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Avatar Statuses</h2>
            <p>All Avatars begin the game in the Basic B1tch status. As a Battleground changes or an item is equipped, statuses will alter the rolls of your Avatar. If no status is mentioned on the current battleground and no items are affecting your character, you are considered a Basic B1tch </p>
            <p>
            <b>Basic B1tch</b>: No status effects<br />
            <b>Cringe</b>: -1 to all rolls<br />
            <b>Amped</b>: +2 to all rolls, Win ties<br />
            <b>Chill</b>: +1 to all rolls<br />
            <b>Enraged</b>: -2 to all rolls<br />

          <div className="mb-6">
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Game Dynamics:</h2>
            <p>
              The game is designed for fluctuating power levels, allowing for unpredictable combat outcomes. 
              Adjustments like using a ten-sided die (d10) can be considered for balancing. Or just alter the rules completely. 
              This is a tabletop game meant to be shared with friend you would feel comfortable mocking in the most offensive way possible.
