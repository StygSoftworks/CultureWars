              <li>Players roll a die and add the result to their avatar's total power (including bonuses, inherent value, battlefield effects).</li>
              <li>The player with the higher power score wins, earning one Supremacy Point.</li>
              <li>The losing avatar must discard an attached card. If unable, they are considered "Found Out" and immune to attack until the next cycle.</li>
              <li>Ties result in the defender winning.</li>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Game Dynamics:</h2>
            <p>
              The game is designed for fluctuating power levels, allowing for unpredictable combat outcomes. Adjustments like using a ten-sided die (d10) can be considered for balancing.
