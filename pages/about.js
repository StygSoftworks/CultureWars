        <h1>Welcome to Culture Wars!</h1>
        <p>
          At Culture Clash Games, we believe in gaming that's as witty as it is engaging. 'Culture Wars' is our latest ventureâ€”a card game that dives headfirst into the cesspool of American subcultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are committed to creating a game that is inclusively insulting and fun.
        </p>
        <p>
        We invite you to be a part of our journey. Whether you're a hardcore gamer or just looking for a fun night with friends, 'Culture Wars' is sure to delight. Stay tuned for updates, expansions, and new game releases from Culture Clash Games.
